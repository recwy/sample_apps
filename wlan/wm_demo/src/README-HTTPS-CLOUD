This README explains the procedure to be followed to setup wm demo
application with HTTPS cloud.

******* Steps *******

Steps to compile wm_demo with HTTPS Cloud support:
-------------------------------------------------

1. Open wlan/wm_demo/config.mk file and enable WEBSOCKET_CLOUD/LONG_POLL_CLOUD and set APPCONFIG_HTTPS_CLOUD to y.
   Disable all other cloud schemes and then build the application

2. Since TLS used by HTTPS based cloud takes lot of memory,
   we need to disable some features in SDK.
   cd wmsdk_bundle-x.y.z
   make menuconfig
   Disable following:
   1. WPS provisioning support in Application framework
   2. WPS in WLAN.

3. Now TLS can be enabled.
   Modules --> TLS ---> Enable TLS Library

4. Compile the SDK and application.
   make BOARD=<board_name> APPS=wlan/wm_demo
   In build Cyassl will be compiled and its library will
   be a part of SDK.


Steps to start Cloud server:
-----------------------------

1. Go to
   wmsdk_bundle-x.y.z/sample_apps/cloud_server
2. Run the commands to install packages
    a. npm install express@3.x
    b. npm install websocket
3. To start cloud server
	sudo node wmcloud.js
4. Please turn off the firewall to allow communication to take place
   between cloud and device
5. For other details please refer README in same directory mentioned
